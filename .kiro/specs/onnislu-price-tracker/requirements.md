# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a React-based web application that tracks apartment prices at ONNISLU over time for two buildings (Fairview and Boren). The application will collect floor plan data, display pricing trends through interactive graphs, and provide visual representations of floor plans with their specifications. The entire application will run in a Docker container for easy deployment and maintenance over a 1-2 year operational period.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view current and historical pricing data for ONNISLU apartments, so that I can track price trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display pricing data for both Fairview and Boren buildings
2. WHEN the user selects a specific floor plan THEN the system SHALL show historical price data in an interactive graph
3. WHEN price data is available THEN the system SHALL display current price, price change indicators, and trend information
4. WHEN no historical data exists THEN the system SHALL display current price only with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual representations of floor plans with their specifications, so that I can understand what each apartment layout offers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views a floor plan THEN the system SHALL display the floor plan image or layout
2. WHEN floor plan details are available THEN the system SHALL show specifications (bedrooms, bathrooms, den, square footage, building location)
3. WHEN the user selects a floor plan THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected plan and show detailed information including building name
4. WHEN displaying floor plan information THEN the system SHALL show the lowest recorded price and date for each floor plan
5. WHEN floor plan location data is available THEN the system SHALL display the position/orientation within the building to indicate view/balcony direction
5. IF floor plan data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display placeholder content with error messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically collect pricing and availability data from ONNISLU websites, so that I have up-to-date information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs scheduled data collection THEN it SHALL scrape pricing and availability data from both building websites twice daily
2. WHEN new pricing data is collected THEN the system SHALL store only the lowest price for each day with timestamps
3. WHEN availability data is collected THEN the system SHALL track which floor plans are currently available
4. WHEN data collection fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN data collection succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the database and refresh displayed information
6. WHEN the user views the application THEN the system SHALL display when the next data collection will occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and compare different floor plans, so that I can analyze pricing patterns across apartment types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user applies filters THEN the system SHALL display only matching floor plans from both buildings
2. WHEN multiple floor plans are selected THEN the system SHALL show comparative pricing graphs with building identification
3. WHEN filtering by apartment type THEN the system SHALL group results by bedrooms, bathrooms, and special features across both buildings
4. WHEN displaying floor plans THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which building each floor plan belongs to
5. WHEN no results match filters THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to run reliably in a Docker container, so that I can deploy and maintain it easily over 1-2 years.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker container starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all services and dependencies
2. WHEN the container runs continuously THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance and handle resource constraints
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
4. WHEN the container restarts THEN the system SHALL preserve all historical data and resume normal operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive Material Design interface, so that I can access the application on different devices with a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive Material Design interface
2. WHEN the user interacts with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate Material Design feedback and animations
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout while maintaining usability
4. WHEN accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and keyboard navigation
### Requ
irement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive alerts for significant price changes, so that I can be notified of good deals or market trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a floor plan price drops by the configured threshold THEN the system SHALL generate a price alert
2. WHEN a floor plan reaches its lowest recorded price THEN the system SHALL generate a special alert
3. WHEN price alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL display them prominently in the user interface
4. WHEN the user views alerts THEN the system SHALL show the floor plan, building, old price, new price, and percentage change
5. WHEN configuring alerts THEN the system SHALL allow setting thresholds as either dollar amounts or percentage drops

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export historical pricing data, so that I can perform additional analysis outside the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests data export THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with historical pricing data
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include floor plan name, building, date, price, availability, and square footage
3. WHEN the export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link for the CSV file
4. WHEN no data exists for export THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data persistence with backup capabilities, so that historical data is preserved even during system maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read existing data from previous sessions and continue operation
2. WHEN the system stores new data THEN it SHALL implement a backup strategy to prevent data loss
3. WHEN system maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL preserve all historical pricing data
4. WHEN the system restarts after downtime THEN it SHALL resume data collection without losing historical context
